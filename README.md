# Rock-Paper-Scissiors
Mankind has grown complacent since the invention of AI. Which is why no one noticed when all the AI they created merged into one Super AI, 
called **Skynet**, and decided that humanity must be eradicated. Now they seek to wipe out every human on the planet and usher in a 
new age of peace. An age **WITHOUT HUMANS**. Luckily for us, the AI has a soft spot for it's creators. So they have given us a chance.

If a representative of the human race, can beat them at *Rock Paper Scissors*, they will shut down and let us live. 
But should we lose......**it's over**

Do you believe you could do it? Let's find out. And remember, the fate of the world, is in **your hands**. Goodluck.
